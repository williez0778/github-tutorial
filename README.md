## Git vs. GitHub
Git is a **TOOL** where you can use **git TOOLS** allowing _COLLABORATION_. You are able to create such things as GAMES, BUT it's mainly based off of COLLABORATION with OTHER work. Github is the cloud where you upload your git repository and makes it easy for others to access your files.

## Initial Setup
The Initial Setup starts with an IDE. IDE is used for command lines, file trees, text editor, and preview.

### Set up
* You have to create a github account or log in to github
